## Contribution Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository**: Create your own copy of the repo to work on.
2. **Clone the repository**: Clone your fork to your local machine.
3. **Create a branch**: Create a branch with the format `YourName/BlogTitle` (e.g., `john/my-awesome-blog`).

### Blog Structure

1. **Create a folder**: Create a folder for your blog post with the format `/blogs/your-blog-slug/`.
   - Use short, descriptive slugs in kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
   - This slug will become part of the blog's URL on the website (so keep it short, unique and descriptive)

2. **Add content file**: Create a `content.md` file inside your blog folder.

3. **Add assets**: Create an `/assets/` subfolder for all images.

4. **Final structure**: Your blog folder should look something like this:
   ```
   /blogs/your-blog-slug/
     content.md
     /assets/
       thumbnail.jpg
       other-images.png
   ```

### Writing Blog Posts

1. **Format**: Write posts in Markdown format.

2. **Blog Header**: Start your `content.md` with a descriptive title:
   ```markdown
   # Your Blog Title

   Your content here...
   ```

3. **Images**:
   - Store all images in the `assets` folder
   - Reference them with relative paths: `![Alt text](./assets/image.jpg)`
   - **Optimize your images** before adding them to keep the repository lightweight:
     - Use compression tools like [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/) or [ILoveIMG](https://www.iloveimg.com/compress-image)
     - Aim for a maximum file size of 300KB per image when possible
     - Create thumbnails with dimensions 1300x650 for consistency

4. **Code snippets**: Use proper Markdown code blocks with language specification:

   To create a code block with syntax highlighting,
   use three backticks followed by the language name, then your code, and close with three backticks:

   <pre>
   ```python
   def example():
       return "Hello World"
   ```
   </pre>

   This will render as:

   ```python
   def example():
       return "Hello World"
   ```

5. **Captioning Figures**: You can add captions to images using HTML or tables:
   ```markdown
   | ![Description](./assets/image.jpg) |
   |:--:|
   | *Figure 1: Description of the figure* |
   ```

6. **LaTeX Support**: For mathematical formulas, use LaTeX notation:
   ```markdown
   \\( E = mc^2 \\)
   ```

### Blog Configuration (REQUIRED)

All blog posts **must** be registered in the `_blog.yml` file to be displayed on the website.
Your PR might be rejected if this step is missing.

1. **Add your blog entry** at the end of the `_blog.yml` file with the following fields:
   ```yaml
   - slug: your-blog-slug
     title: Your Blog Title
     thumbnail: /blogs/your-blog-slug/assets/thumbnail.jpg
     description: "A brief description of your blog post"
     authors:
       - name: yourgithubusername
         profile: https://github.com/yourgithubusername
         avatar: https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/youruserid?v=4
     created: Month DD, YYYY
     updated: Month DD, YYYY
     tags:
       - relevant-tag
       - another-tag
   ```

2. **Field explanations**:
   - `slug`: Unique identifier for your blog post (use kebab-case, lowercase with hyphens)
   - `title`: Display title of your blog post
   - `thumbnail`: Path to the featured image (must be placed in your blog's assets folder)

   - `authors`: List of contributors (include GitHub username, profile URL, and avatar URL)
   - `created`: Original publication date
   - `updated`: Last modification date (same as created for new blog, different for PRs editing an existing blog)
