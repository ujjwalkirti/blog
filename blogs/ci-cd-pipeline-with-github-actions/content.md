## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of software development, having a reliable and efficient CI/CD pipeline is crucial for delivering high-quality applications. This blog explores my journey of setting up a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for an Angular frontend and an Express backend.

My goal was to streamline the deployment process, reduce manual intervention, and ensure that both the frontend and backend are always in sync. Through this blog, I will delve into the specific challenges I faced, the innovative solutions I implemented, and the expertise I gained along the way. Whether you're looking to enhance your own CI/CD processes or simply curious about the intricacies of deploying complex applications, this blog offers valuable insights and practical strategies.

## Innovative Deployment Strategies

While setting up the CI/CD pipelines for my Angular frontend and Express backend, I encountered several challenges that required creative solutions. Here's a look at some of the innovative strategies I implemented to tackle these issues and enhance the deployment process.

### Dynamic Slot Management

**The Challenge:**
With multiple environments and frequent deployments, managing deployment slots efficiently was a real headache. I needed a way to ensure that each deployment used the correct slot without causing conflicts, allowing for smooth transitions between different versions of the application.

**My Approach:**
I came up with a dynamic slot management system that automatically picks the next available deployment slot for both the frontend and backend. This system updates slot files to keep track of the last used slots, ensuring that each deployment is isolated and doesn't interfere with others. By automating slot selection, I minimized the risk of deployment conflicts and cut down on manual work.

### Secure and Efficient Image Transfer

**The Challenge:**
Transferring Docker images securely and efficiently to the server was crucial, especially given the size of the images and the need for frequent updates. I needed a fast and secure transfer process to minimize downtime during deployments.

**My Approach:**
I used `sshpass` and `scp` for secure file transfers, along with Docker's image saving and loading features. This combination ensured that images were transferred quickly and securely, reducing deployment time and boosting the reliability of the process.

**Note:** Currently, I am not utilizing any third-party services like AWS ECR or Docker Registry to store Docker images. Instead, images are managed and transferred directly between local environments and the deployment server. This approach simplifies the setup but may limit scalability and flexibility in the long term.

### Synchronizing Frontend and Backend Deployments

**The Challenge:**
Keeping the frontend and backend in sync during deployments was essential to avoid compatibility issues and ensure a smooth user experience. Mismatches between frontend and backend versions could lead to errors and inconsistencies.

**My Approach:**
I developed a system to capture and store commit hashes for both frontend and backend deployments. This allowed me to verify that the correct versions were deployed together, reducing the risk of mismatches and ensuring consistent functionality across the application. By maintaining a record of deployed versions, I could easily track and manage deployments, ensuring that both parts of the application were always aligned.

### Automating Environment Configuration

**The Challenge:**
Configuring environment variables dynamically for each deployment was necessary to ensure that the application pointed to the correct services and endpoints. Manual configuration was error-prone and time-consuming.

**My Approach:**
I automated the modification of environment configuration files (`environment.ts`) during the build process. This automation ensured that each deployment had the correct URLs and settings, tailored to the specific deployment slot being used. By automating environment configuration, I eliminated the risk of human error and streamlined the deployment process.

These strategies not only addressed the specific challenges I faced but also made the entire deployment process more robust and scalable. It was a rewarding experience to see these solutions come together and significantly improve the efficiency of my CI/CD pipeline.

## Frontend CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

The frontend of my application is built using Angular, a popular framework for building dynamic web applications. Setting up a CI/CD pipeline for the Angular frontend involved creating workflows that automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that new features and updates are delivered efficiently.

### Development Workflow

The development workflow is triggered by pull requests, allowing me to test changes in a controlled environment before merging them into the main branch. Here's how the workflow is structured:

- **Trigger:** The workflow is activated on pull requests that are opened, synchronized, or reopened, except for those from the `main` branch.

  ```yaml
  on:
    pull_request:
      types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  ```

- **Environment Setup:** The workflow begins by checking out the code from the pull request and setting up Docker Buildx for building Docker images.

  ```yaml
  steps:
    - name: Checkout repository
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
      with:
        ref: ${{ github.event.pull_request.head.sha }}

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1
  ```

- **Slot Management:** A dynamic slot management system selects the next available deployment slot, ensuring that each deployment is isolated and does not interfere with others.

  ```yaml
  - name: Select Deployment Slot
    id: get_slot
    run: |
      SYNCED_SLOT=$(sshpass -p "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" ssh -T -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}@${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }} << 'EOF' | tail -n 1
        # Logic to determine the next slot
      EOF
      )
      echo "DEPLOY_SLOT=$(echo $SYNCED_SLOT | tr -d '\r')" >> $GITHUB_ENV
  ```

- **Docker Image Management:** The Angular application is built into a Docker image, which is then transferred to the selected deployment slot on the server.

  ```yaml
  - name: Build & tag Docker image
    run: |
      docker build -t angular-app-dev-slot-${{ env.DEPLOY_SLOT }} .
      docker save angular-app-dev-slot-${{ env.DEPLOY_SLOT }} -o angular-app-dev-slot-${{ env.DEPLOY_SLOT }}.tar
  ```

- **Post-Deployment Actions:** After deployment, several steps are taken to ensure the deployment is successful and visible to the team:

  - **Update Slot Files:** The workflow updates slot files to keep track of the last used slots for both frontend and backend, ensuring that future deployments use the correct slots.

    ```yaml
    - name: Update FE/BE last slot text file
      run: |
        sshpass -p "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}@${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }} "
        set -euo pipefail
        # Define the paths to the FE and BE slot files
        BE_SLOT_FILE='/path/to/be/last_slot.txt'
        FE_SLOT_FILE='/path/to/fe/last_slot.txt'

        # Update slot files
        echo \"${{ env.DEPLOY_SLOT }}\" > \"\$BE_SLOT_FILE\"
        echo \"${{ env.DEPLOY_SLOT }}\" > \"\$FE_SLOT_FILE\"
        "
    ```

  - **Post Deployment Comment:** A comment is posted on the pull request with deployment details, providing visibility into the deployment process and ensuring that all team members are informed of the latest changes.

    ```yaml
    - name: Post Deployment Comment on PR
      uses: actions/github-script@v6
      with:
        github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        script: |
          const slot = process.env.DEPLOY_SLOT;
          const devUrl = `https://dev-url-for-slot-${slot}.example.com`;
          const commentBody = `
          ðŸš€ **Deployment is Successful!**
          - **Frontend Slot:** ${slot}
          - **Dev URL:** [${devUrl}](${devUrl})
          âœ… The Angular app has been successfully deployed.
          `;

          const issue_number = context.payload.pull_request.number;
          const owner = context.repo.owner;
          const repo = context.repo.repo;

          await github.request('POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}/comments', {
            owner,
            repo,
            issue_number,
            body: commentBody,
          });
    ```

### Production Workflow

The production workflow is designed to deploy stable releases to the live environment, ensuring that users always have access to the latest features and improvements. Here's an overview of the production workflow:

- **Trigger:** The workflow is triggered by pushes to the `main` branch, indicating that the code is ready for production.

  ```

- **Deployment:** The Docker image is loaded on the server, and the `angular-app` service is updated using Docker Compose, ensuring a seamless transition to the new version.

  ```yaml
  - name: Load and deploy Docker image on the server
    run: |
      sshpass -p "${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no ${{ secrets.SSH_USER }}@${{ secrets.SERVER_IP }} "
        echo '${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}' | sudo -S docker load -i /path/to/angular-app.tar && \
        cd /path/to/deployment && \
        echo '${{ secrets.SSH_PRIVATE_KEY }}' | sudo -S docker-compose up -d angular-app
      "
  ```

By automating these processes with GitHub Actions, I have achieved a streamlined and efficient CI/CD pipeline for the Angular frontend, reducing manual intervention and accelerating the delivery of new features.
